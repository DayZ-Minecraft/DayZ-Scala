You are one of the few who have survived and now you must search this new wasteland in order to fight for your life against what is left of the indigenous population, now infected with the disease. Go solo or team up with friends and take on the world as you choose your path in this brutal and chilling landscape using whatever means you stumble upon to survive.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nDayZ is installed like any other Minecraft Forge mod, by placing the mod in the client or server's mods folder. Minecraft Forge installation instructions can be found [here](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Universal).\r\n\r\nOnce installed, a new Dayz world can be started by selecting one of the DayZ world types on the client or by adding ```level-type=DAYZBASE``` to the server.properties file and regeneration a new world\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Got an Issue or Suggestion?\r\nIdeas and suggestions are always welcome on our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/DayZ-Minecraft/DayZ/issues).
